This project aims to analyse and understand the performance of Manchester City FC in Premier League between 2013 and 2023. By delving into data from this period, the project aims to reveal the factors behind Manchester City's success.
## Context of project
Manchester City FC has achieved its best results in over 100 years in the last ten seasons，from a club that has been relegated 2 times to the most dominant newborn powerhouse club in the Premier League. This is due to the continued investment of the Abu Dhabi consortium, Ajinkya K in her study in 2021 attempted to establish a relationship between the money invested by City Football Group in Manchester City and try to relate it to City's success over the last couple of years's. But high investment does not necessarily mean the arrival of champions, in fact Manchester City is not the most invested club but managed to win the Premier League title five times in six years. Jonathan M and Christine O have pointed out that good corporate governance is essential if a club is to be effectively managed.By analysing the data of Manchester City in this period, we can deepen our understanding of club operations.
